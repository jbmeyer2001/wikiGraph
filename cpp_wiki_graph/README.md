# cpp_wiki_graph

all of the files in this folder excluding src/main.cpp is a doctored version of the
https://github.com/pybind/scikit_build_example repository with 'scikit_build_example'
replaced with 'cpp_wiki_graph'. The src/main.cpp file is the location of my cpp code,
the rest is an example I am using to make building the cpp into a python module easier.
